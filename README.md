# 4Chan-Archiver
I got bored and made this. It's a mess but it will scrape 4chan for a thread with a certain title like "ylyl"

You need to make a .env file
```
board=""
searchTerm=""
```
If you leave searchTerm blank it will scrap everything posted. I would not do this because the are better solutions out there for this.
